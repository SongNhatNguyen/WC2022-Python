With the rapid development of technology today, along with mathematical tools, weather forecasts, natural disaster predictions, etc., are becoming increasingly integrated into our daily lives. Of course, we cannot forget one of the biggest entertainment sports on the planet – football (soccer), with its massive global fanbase promising a lucrative opportunity for investors, and naturally, for companies specializing in predicting results, placing bets, and betting on football.

In the past, during the 1940s and 50s, people could only get an overview of a match and draw conclusions about whether a team was strong or weak based on very subjective results, or with very little input data. Computers at that time were not yet developed fast enough, powerful enough, or with enough capacity to store a large database to provide the most accurate results.

However, entering the 21st century with the rapid development of semiconductor technology, people have found ways to shrink the size of processors, memory, RAM, etc., while having more space and storing a huge amount of data. From there, predicting results and betting on matches has flourished, becoming a lucrative business not only in football but also in many other sports.
Football is simply the king of making money among all sports, and with the help of current technology, people are beginning to make more accurate predictions about future results with lower error rates, thanks to the enormous storage capacity of modern computers. With millions of different match data files.

Although the 2022 World Cup ended two weeks ago, in this report, I still decided to build a simple model to predict results. With the help of data from Wikipedia, let's examine the discrepancies between the results of the 2022 World Cup that actually took place and those predicted in this report. What causes these differences, and what factors differentiate between real-world events and computer-generated data?
